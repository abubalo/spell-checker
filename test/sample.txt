Once upon a time, there lived a biiig, friendly dino named Danny. Danny had a lonnng tail and spiky scales. Every mornin', he woke up and tumbled out of his cozzy cave.

Danny's best frend was a little birdie named Bebee. Bebee had brighhht feathers that sparkled like a rainbow. They played tag and hide-an-seek together, laughin' and chirpin' all day long.

One day, Danny found a shiiiny rock in the river. "Wow, this is the prettiest rock I've ever seen," he thought. He put it in his pouch and showed it to Bebee. "Look, Bebee! I found a magik rock!"

Bebee looked closely and giggled. "Danny, that's just a regular rock. But it's still nice!"

Danny laughed too. "You're right, Bebee! It's nice becauuse it reminds me of our fun adventures."

As the sun set, Danny and Bebee sat by the river, watchin' the stars twinkle in the night sky. "Bebee," said Danny, "even though we find lots of things, the best treasure we have is each other."

Bebee smiled and gave a little chirp. "You're the best frend, Danny. No treassure can beaat that!"

And so, Danny and Bebee continued their playful days and magical nights, cherishing their friendshiip forever.

The end.
